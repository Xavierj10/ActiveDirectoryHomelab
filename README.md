## Lab Overview
### In this lab you will learn how to: 
  - Set up VirtualBox
  - Set up Windows Server2019
  - Set up Microsoft Active Directory
  - Add 25 users manually to Active Directory
  - Create 5 seperate workgroups to separate the users into
  
  
 ## Step One: Set up VirtualBox and Active Directory
  - To get fully set up I recommend following along to [Josh Madakdor's Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsI8hJmggI)
  #### I recommend this video because its straight to the point and easy to follow along. He talks about setting an internal network and using a powershell script but I wouldnt worry about those this project is meant to introduce you to Active Directory and How it works.
